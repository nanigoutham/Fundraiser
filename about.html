          <p>Our FundRaiser is an NGO for poor child education, Giving a helping hand to a needy one is not only a responsibility, but it’s also an act of humanity that we show towards others. We can make a difference in their lives even with a little – it doesn’t demand that much, just a little of what we have and a little of our time. We can change their lives and give them a good will & happiness, by showing them hospitalty and love. We can care for what they need and we can give them this even with just a smile and a good deed. Being poor doesn’t make them a different people or unwanted, it’s just a life course that they faced. So I say that we should help everyone, no matter what colour, race or religion they have.</p>
